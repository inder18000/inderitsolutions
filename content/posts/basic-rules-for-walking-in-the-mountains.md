Corporate leaders love to talk about values. They put them on web sites, frame them, place them prominently in boardrooms and proudly espouse them in media interviews. The notion of values has become so pervasive that it’s hard to find any CEO who doesn’t tout their importance.



Yet all too often, values are little more than window dressing. Key stakeholders, including employees, customers and partners are either completely unaware what the stated values are or don’t believe that they ring true. In some cases, corporate talk about values amounts to no more than a cruel joke.



I doesn’t start out that way. It’s hard to imagine that even the most jaded executive team would formulate values they didn’t believe in. Rather, the problem is usually that values are easy to write down, but hard to live up to. So what begins with a sincere effort ends with a lofty checklist of anodyne virtues that don't reflect reality. Here’s how to create values that stick.
