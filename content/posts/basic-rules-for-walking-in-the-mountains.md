Corporate leaders love to talk about values. They put them on web sites, frame them, place them prominently in boardrooms and proudly espouse them in media interviews. The notion of values has become so pervasive that it’s hard to find any CEO who doesn’t tout their importance.



Yet all too often, values are little more than window dressing. Key stakeholders, including employees, customers and partners are either completely unaware what the stated values are or don’t believe that they ring true. In some cases, corporate talk about values amounts to no more than a cruel joke.



I doesn’t start out that way. It’s hard to imagine that even the most jaded executive team would formulate values they didn’t believe in. Rather, the problem is usually that values are easy to write down, but hard to live up to. So what begins with a sincere effort ends with a lofty checklist of anodyne virtues that don't reflect reality. Here’s how to create values that stick.

## Values Cost Something

## 

## In workshops with executive boards, I often ask what the company’s values are.  Invariably, I get a list of things like, “excellence,” “serving customers” and “innovation.”  Then I ask a follow up question, “What do these values cost you?”  Usually, all I get is blank stares.

## Make no mistake, values cost something.  For example, both Nucor and Southwest show that they value employees by pledging never to do layoffs and both companies have paid a price for that policy.  In the decades they have been in operation, there have been times when there was a strong business case for letting some people go.  But they didn’t.

## Values Have A Purpose

## 

## Many leaders who want to stress customer service like to cite the famous story about Nordstrom taking back a tire from a customer, even though the company doesn’t sell tires or anything like them.  The tale is supposed to support the notion that the company will do anything, no matter how seemingly outrageous, to serve its customers.

## 

## Yet the story blurs the lines between stupidity and virtue.  Someone asking for a refund for a product that they did not purchase from you is more likely to be a charlatan than a customer. Even worse, any firm following such a policy would have to lay the costs of fraudulent returns on real stakeholders such as customers, employees and shareholders, betraying their good faith.

## 

## And in fact, the real story is somewhat different than the one often told. The location had been a tire store which was recently converted to a Nordstrom store.  The manager, concluding that the customer was confused, but sincere, decided to allow the refund.  That’s not quite the same thing as taking back any random product.

## 

## Values need to have a purpose, which in this case was to always err on the side of living up to promises—even if they are merely perceived promises—to inspire absolute trust. Giving refunds for any claim, no matter how fraudulent or far-fetched, would serve no one but bankruptcy lawyers.

## Values Lead To Action

## 

## At my former company, we valued a collaborative approach.  Many organizations do.  However, we took it a bit further and pledged to fire nasty people and it cost us.  By routinely parting ways with people who were abusive to junior staff and disrespectful toward their peers, we lost some very talented people.

## 

## Yet we gained a lot more. By following up our values with action, we created a much nicer place to work. That helped us reduce employee turnover and recruit more talented people. It also allowed us to demand more of our employees, such as instituting an “always help” rule in which nobody was allowed to say, “sorry, but that’s not my job.”
